# Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) — Theory

This repository provides a high-level overview of **Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM)** concepts, focusing on authentication, passwordless authentication, passkeys, authorization models, and IAM fundamentals.

---

## 📌 What is Authentication?

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system to ensure they are who (or what) they claim to be.

---

## 🔐 Passwordless Authentication

**Passwordless Authentication** is a security approach that allows users to sign in without traditional passwords.  
Instead, it uses more secure and user-friendly alternatives to verify identity.

### Passwordless Authentication Approaches

1. **One-Time Passcodes (OTP), Biometrics, or Magic Links**
   - Delivered via **Email** or **SMS**
2. **Passkeys**
   - Based on the **WebAuthn** standard and supported by the **FIDO Alliance**

---

## 🔑 Passkeys

Passkeys replace passwords with cryptographic key pairs for stronger and phishing-resistant authentication.

### How Passkeys Work

- 🔒 **Private Key** stays securely on the user’s device
- 🌐 **Public Key** is stored on the server
- ✍️ Device signs a server-generated challenge using the private key
- ✅ Server verifies the signature using the public key

---

### ✅ Benefits of Passkeys

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Uses biometrics or hardware-based verification
2. **Device-Independent**
   - Can sync securely across devices
3. **Phishing-Resistant**
   - No passwords to steal or reuse
4. **High Security**
   - Strong public-key cryptography
5. **User Convenience**
   - No passwords to remember
6. **No Password Resets**
   - Eliminates recovery and reset flows

---

## 🔁 Passkey Authentication Flows

### Registration Flow

1. User visits the website or application for the first time
2. Server generates a cryptographic challenge
3. Device signs the challenge after biometric or PIN verification
4. Public key is sent and stored on the server for future logins

---

### Authentication Flow

1. Server sends a new challenge
2. Device signs the challenge using the private key (after biometric/PIN verification)
3. Server verifies the signature using the stored public key
4. User is successfully authenticated

---

## 🛂 Authorization Models

Authorization determines **what an authenticated user is allowed to do**.

### Common Authorization Models

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Access based on assigned roles
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Access based on user, resource, and environment attributes
3. **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**
   - Access driven by defined policies and rules

---

## 🧩 What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that ensures:

> The right people (or systems) have the right access to the right resources at the right time.

---

### 🏛 Three Fundamental Pillars of IAM

1. **User Authentication**
2. **User Authorization**
3. **User Management**

---

## ⚙️ Key IAM Features

1. **Automation and Centralization**
2. **Enforced Security Controls**
3. **Enhanced User Experience**

---

## 🔐 Importance of IAM for Security & Compliance

1. **Protect Digital Resources**
2. **Ensure Regulatory Compliance**


## What is CIAM?

Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) manages customer identities, authentication, authorization, and profile data for consumer-facing applications and digital services.

#### Key Feature
1. User Registration and login
2. Social Login
3. Multi-factor Authentication(MFA)
4. Single sign-on (SSO)
5. Passwordless Authentication
6. User lifecycle Management


### key Protocols in CIAM
1. OAuth 2.0 : Used for authorization, granting access to resources without sharing credentials.
2. OpenID Connect (OIDC): Adds an identity layer to oAuth 2.0, handling both authentication and authorization.
3. SAML: An older but widely used protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data.

## Identity Providers(IdPS) in CIAM
1. Identity Providers(IdPs) are critical in CIAM,Managing user authentication.
2. IdPs verify user identity and provide secure access to services without handling passwords directly.
3. For CIAM, using IdPs like Auth0 simplifies identity management across platforms.
